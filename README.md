### Description:

The purpose of this project is to use Puppeteer, a node library, to automate the administrative work of setting up HackerRank and Zoom meeting invitations.

### Technology:

- Puppeteer
- Google Calendar API

### Setup:

1. `Git Pull` this Repo
2. Run `NPM install`
3. Create a personal folder
4. Create a `passowrd.js` file within the personal folder. The entire folder has already been included in the `.gitignore` file. Shuold always double check to avoid credential being push out in public.
5. In the password.js add you Hacker Rank and Zoom credentials (feel free to change the naming convention but please remember to update the required file path.)
